# Configs
  The purpose of this branch is to make easier the use of custom configuration.
  For the moment configs are .cfg files (zipped files) wich contains two files.
  
  - ```config.json``` : This one is empty for the moment, but the Editor loads it at startup and the parsed json is saved in a global variable. It could contains anything.
  - ```palette.gp``` : This file can be used to change categories of the editor their and colors. 
  
# Things to do
  
- For the moment it is impossible to create a .cfg file that modify just some things and keep the default values for things that are not specified. 
- A GUI (clearly not soon but it would be quite awesome)
