# GP-CommunityEdition

The GP Blocks programming system forked and improved by the community.

GP is a "general purpose" blocks programming system similar to Scratch, but
with  extended features such as the ability to work with pixel and sound data,
process data, or build games and applications. What's more, GP can turn anything
you build into an application.

## Library Loader

This branch makes possible loading any custom runtime folder after loading the VM. It means an easier way of working with mods because there is no need of multiples Gp folders with each one with it's own executable. It would be also a possible way of sharing mods as zipped runtime folder using GP cloud.

## What Doesn't work

  - Appmaker doesn't
  - This currently only load libraries and startup.gp. It will not load any other file of the runtime folder
  - Others...
