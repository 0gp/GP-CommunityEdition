# GP-Mods

The GP Blocks programming system in a form that is easy to fork and modify.
GP is a "general purpose" blocks programming system similar to Scratch, but
with many more features (such as the ability to work with pixel and sound data,
process data, or build games and applications. What's more, GP can turn anything
you build into an application.

## Creating a Mod

To make your own GP mod, first create a (free!) Github account if you don't already have one.
Then click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of this repository. That will create
your own "fork" on Github. If you wish, rename your copy by clicking on the "Settings"
tab in your fork. Finally, make a clone of your repository on your own computer and start
modding!

## Wiki

The Wiki on this repository will eventually include articles explaining how GP works,
how it loads the entire system from "runtime/lib" when it starts, and how to make changes.

## User Forum

Ask questions and share what you've created with others on the "GP Mods" section of the
GP Forum (http://gpblocks.org/forum). Unfortunately, due to a constant barrage of spammers
creating accounts, we had to disable automatic account creation; just drop an email to
"gpteam" at gpblocks.org.

## Based on GP...

To avoid potential confusion with the original GP, which is used by students and educators
around the world, your mod should be named something other than simply "GP" or "GP Blocks,
and it should avoid displaying the original GP logo. You are  welcome to use the "GP Mod"
logo and encouraged to use the phrase "Based on GP" in your mod's title or about box.
